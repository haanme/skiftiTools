Description: SKIFTI files contain brain imaging data in coordinates across Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) skeleton, which 
    represent the brain white matter intensity values. 
    'skiftiTools' provides a unified environment for reading, writing, 
    visualizing and manipulating SKIFTI-format data. It supports the "subsetting", 
    "concatenating", and using data as data.frame for R statistical functions. The SKIFTI data is structured for convenient access to the data and metadata,
    and includes support for visualizations.
